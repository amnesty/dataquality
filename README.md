Data Quality
============

Data quality functions allows you to perform certain validations in your data, such as verify control digits in bank accounts, correct the capitalization of names and surnames, etc.

What kind of validations do these functions perform?
----------------------------------------------------

The functions contained here are intended to be used to check the data of a CRM database. So you'll find functions to validate document numbers (Spanish NIFs, NIEs and CIFs), control digits of bank account numbers, etc.

How are these functions organised?
----------------------------------

I don't want to obtain a result when I execute a validation and JavaScript and a diffent one if I do the same validation in MySQL. You'll find different folders for each language. Be patient, I'll be adding translations soon. Feel free to commit yours.

The idea is to have the same functions in different languages, creating them in the most similar possible way (using the same names for variables, functions, etc).
